# Bert-email-classification
The spam detection model will classify emails as spam or not spam. This will be used to filter unwanted and unsolicited emails. 
We will build this model using BERT and Tensorflow
BERT will be used to generate sentence encoding for all emails. Finally, we will use Tensorflow to build the neural networks. Tensorflow will create the input and output layers of our machine learning model.
Building model started by using BERT to convert a given sentence into an embedding vector. This was done using the pre-trained BERT models.
The model uses TensorFlow and initialized all the input and output layers. We followed all the stages of building the neural network and finally came up with a spam detection model. Finally, we used the model to make predictions, the model was able to give accurate predictions.
